                <h3 style="color: black">1. Risk Warning</h3>
                <p >Prospective clients should study the following risk warnings very carefully. Please note that we do not explore or explain all the risks involved when dealing in Financial Instruments (including Contracts for Difference “the CFDs” and Equities). We outline the general nature of the risks of dealing in Financial Instruments on a fair and non-misleading basis.

                    In particular, Contracts for Difference ('CFDs') are complex financial products and not suitable for all investors. CFDs, are leveraged products that mature when you choose to close an existing open position. By investing in CFDs, you assume a high level of risk and can result in the loss of all of your invested capital.

                    Unless a client knows and fully understands the risks involved in each Financial Instrument, they should not engage in any trading activity. You should not risk more than you are prepared to lose. FTM will not provide clients with any investment advice in relation to investments, possible transactions in investments, or Financial Instruments, neither will we make any investment recommendations. Clients should consider which Financial Instrument is suitable for them according to their financial status and goals before opening an account with FTM. If a client is unclear about the risks involved in trading in Financial Instruments, then they should consult an independent financial advisor. If the client still doesn't understand these risks after consulting an independent financial advisor, then they should refrain from trading at all. Purchasing and selling Financial Instruments comes with a significant risk of losses and damages and each client must understand that the investment value can both increase and decrease, clients they are liable for all these losses and damages, which could result in more than the initial invested capital once they make the decision has been made to trade.</p>
